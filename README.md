# acl-hubot

Simple coffee script to implement hubot ACL for executing commands. Replace hubot name in the script with the name of your bot.
Placed under `hubot/scripts/` directory.

Simple and dirty :)

## Requirements

* underscore
* util

So adding `"underscore": "^1.8.3"` to `package.json` for dependencies under `hubot/` directory and running `npm install` should install it for you.
